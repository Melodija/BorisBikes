BORIS BIKES

Makers Academy Project Week 1

This is a simulated version of the 'Boris' Bikes Project.

'Boris' Bikes is London's self-service, bike-sharing scheme for short journeys
You can hire a bike from as little as Â£2. Simply go to any docking station with
your bank card and touch the screen to get started.

There's no need to book - hire a bike, ride it where you like, then return it
to any docking station.

In the following program we simulate all bikes that can be rented and used as
well as the docking stations located around London and the infrastructure.
